# Guid Generator
This is a simple Windows application that generates a GUID directly from the Notification Area (System Tray) in Windows. With just a click, users can easily generate a new GUID, which is automatically copied to the clipboard for immediate use. <br>
The application runs in the background, offering a convenient and quick way to generate unique identifiers without interrupting your workflow. <br>
It also features a system tray icon that provides access to generate GUIDs or exit the program with a simple right-click menu. <br>
